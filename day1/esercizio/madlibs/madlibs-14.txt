HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many STICKY photographers make big money
photographing PLUTOs and beautiful SANDWICHs. They sell
the prints to BITTER magazines or to agencies who use
them in JELLYFISH advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a BANANA camera. You also need an
GRUMPY meter and filters and a special close-up
SAURON. Then you either hire professional SANDWICHs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary VIOLINs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very WEARILY for at
least 0 years.
