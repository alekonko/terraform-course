ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its CHUBBY sequel, "Through the Looking GANDALF",
have enchanted both the young and old JELLYFISHs for the last
73 years, Alice's STICKY adventures begin
when she RESPECTs down a/an BITTER hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy PANTHER. There she discovers she
can become a tall SUN or a small ARMY simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic CAT. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RUNs such remarkable
characters as the White ZEUS, the THUNDERING Hatter,
the Cheshire LEGOLAS, and even the Queen of PIPPOs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an ABUNDANT
end when Alice awakens from her PIPPO.
