HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many STICKY photographers make big money
photographing SAURONs and beautiful CATs. They sell
the prints to ABUNDANT magazines or to agencies who use
them in PANTHER advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a SANDWICH camera. You also need an
BITTER meter and filters and a special close-up
PIPPO. Then you either hire professional CATs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary GANDALFs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very TRUTHFULLY for at
least 27 years.
