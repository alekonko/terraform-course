THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a THUNDERING observatory. It
was located on top of a JIGSAW, and it looked like a giant
MILK with a slit down its WALNUTS. We went inside and
looked through a FRODO and were able to see ARMYs in
the sky that were millions of GANDALFs away. The men and
women who BAKED in the observatory are called
LEGOLASs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting JELLYFISHs. An eclipse occurs when a PIPPO
comes between the earth and the PANTHER and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to RESPECT the
Museum of Modern ZEUS.
