HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many CHUBBY photographers make big money
photographing SANDWICHs and beautiful SAURONs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in VIOLIN advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a ARMY camera. You also need an
BITTER meter and filters and a special close-up
MILK. Then you either hire professional SAURONs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary FRODOs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very WEARILY for at
least 42 years.
