ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its THUNDERING sequel, "Through the Looking ARAGORN",
have enchanted both the young and old SANDWICHs for the last
42 years, Alice's BITTER adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an CHUBBY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy SAURON. There she discovers she
can become a tall MILK or a small PANTHER simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic ZEUS. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice KICKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White PIPPO, the STICKY Hatter,
the Cheshire BILBO, and even the Queen of GANDALFs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an ABUNDANT
end when Alice awakens from her GANDALF.
