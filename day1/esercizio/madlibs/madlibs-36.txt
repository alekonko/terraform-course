ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its CHUBBY sequel, "Through the Looking SUN",
have enchanted both the young and old JIGSAWs for the last
27 years, Alice's GRUMPY adventures begin
when she RESPECTs down a/an BITTER hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy VIOLIN. There she discovers she
can become a tall JELLYFISH or a small BILBO simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic GANDALF. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RUNs such remarkable
characters as the White BANANA, the ABUNDANT Hatter,
the Cheshire ZEUS, and even the Queen of CATs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an STICKY
end when Alice awakens from her CAT.
