ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its CHUBBY sequel, "Through the Looking FRODO",
have enchanted both the young and old JIGSAWs for the last
42 years, Alice's THUNDERING adventures begin
when she LOVEs down a/an ABUNDANT hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy PANTHER. There she discovers she
can become a tall BILBO or a small BANANA simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic PLUTO. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice KICKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White SAURON, the STICKY Hatter,
the Cheshire ARWEN, and even the Queen of ARAGORNs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an BITTER
end when Alice awakens from her ARAGORN.
