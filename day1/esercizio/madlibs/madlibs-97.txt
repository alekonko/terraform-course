THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a GRUMPY observatory. It
was located on top of a ARMY, and it looked like a giant
PANTHER with a slit down its ZEUS. We went inside and
looked through a PIPPO and were able to see SUNs in
the sky that were millions of MILKs away. The men and
women who RESPECT in the observatory are called
LEGOLASs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting FRODOs. An eclipse occurs when a SAURON
comes between the earth and the ARWEN and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to KICKED the
Museum of Modern ARAGORN.
