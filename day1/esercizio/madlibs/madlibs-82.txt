THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a STICKY observatory. It
was located on top of a ARWEN, and it looked like a giant
GANDALF with a slit down its BILBO. We went inside and
looked through a PANTHER and were able to see SUNs in
the sky that were millions of BANANAs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
ZEUSs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting JELLYFISHs. An eclipse occurs when a JIGSAW
comes between the earth and the ARMY and everything
gets ABUNDANT. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern MILK.
