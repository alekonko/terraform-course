HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many STICKY photographers make big money
photographing GANDALFs and beautiful FRODOs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in SAURON advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a VIOLIN camera. You also need an
ABUNDANT meter and filters and a special close-up
SUN. Then you either hire professional FRODOs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary JIGSAWs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very BEAUTIFULLY for at
least -5 years.
