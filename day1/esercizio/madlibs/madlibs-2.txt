HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many BITTER photographers make big money
photographing GOLLUMs and beautiful LEGOLASs. They sell
the prints to GRUMPY magazines or to agencies who use
them in BILBO advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a ARMY camera. You also need an
CHUBBY meter and filters and a special close-up
PANTHER. Then you either hire professional LEGOLASs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary SUNs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very WEARILY for at
least 73 years.
