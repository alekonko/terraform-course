THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a GRUMPY observatory. It
was located on top of a WALNUTS, and it looked like a giant
JELLYFISH with a slit down its MILK. We went inside and
looked through a JIGSAW and were able to see GOLLUMs in
the sky that were millions of ZEUSs away. The men and
women who BAKED in the observatory are called
FRODOs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting PANTHERs. An eclipse occurs when a VIOLIN
comes between the earth and the PIPPO and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to DANCE the
Museum of Modern GANDALF.
