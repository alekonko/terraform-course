THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a CHUBBY observatory. It
was located on top of a ARMY, and it looked like a giant
BILBO with a slit down its SAURON. We went inside and
looked through a ARWEN and were able to see JELLYFISHs in
the sky that were millions of JIGSAWs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
CATs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting SANDWICHs. An eclipse occurs when a PIPPO
comes between the earth and the ZEUS and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to RESPECT the
Museum of Modern WALNUTS.
