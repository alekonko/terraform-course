HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many THUNDERING photographers make big money
photographing BANANAs and beautiful PIPPOs. They sell
the prints to CHUBBY magazines or to agencies who use
them in MILK advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a JELLYFISH camera. You also need an
STICKY meter and filters and a special close-up
ZEUS. Then you either hire professional PIPPOs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary PANTHERs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very BEAUTIFULLY for at
least 0 years.
