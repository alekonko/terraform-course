ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its ABUNDANT sequel, "Through the Looking ZEUS",
have enchanted both the young and old SUNs for the last
73 years, Alice's GRUMPY adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an CHUBBY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy VIOLIN. There she discovers she
can become a tall SANDWICH or a small GOLLUM simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic CAT. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RUNs such remarkable
characters as the White ARMY, the THUNDERING Hatter,
the Cheshire JIGSAW, and even the Queen of ARWENs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an STICKY
end when Alice awakens from her ARWEN.
