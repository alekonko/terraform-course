THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a ABUNDANT observatory. It
was located on top of a ARAGORN, and it looked like a giant
BANANA with a slit down its GOLLUM. We went inside and
looked through a SAURON and were able to see ARMYs in
the sky that were millions of PANTHERs away. The men and
women who RUN in the observatory are called
FRODOs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting ZEUSs. An eclipse occurs when a JIGSAW
comes between the earth and the MILK and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to RESPECT the
Museum of Modern LEGOLAS.
