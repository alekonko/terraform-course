ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its ABUNDANT sequel, "Through the Looking SAURON",
have enchanted both the young and old VIOLINs for the last
101 years, Alice's GRUMPY adventures begin
when she LOVEs down a/an BITTER hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy WALNUTS. There she discovers she
can become a tall JIGSAW or a small ARWEN simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic PLUTO. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RUNs such remarkable
characters as the White MILK, the STICKY Hatter,
the Cheshire SUN, and even the Queen of CATs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an THUNDERING
end when Alice awakens from her CAT.
