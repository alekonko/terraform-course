THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a GRUMPY observatory. It
was located on top of a ZEUS, and it looked like a giant
SANDWICH with a slit down its SAURON. We went inside and
looked through a JELLYFISH and were able to see BILBOs in
the sky that were millions of PANTHERs away. The men and
women who BAKED in the observatory are called
PLUTOs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting GOLLUMs. An eclipse occurs when a JIGSAW
comes between the earth and the BANANA and everything
gets CHUBBY. Next week, we place to RESPECT the
Museum of Modern VIOLIN.
