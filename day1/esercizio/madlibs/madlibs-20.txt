HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many BITTER photographers make big money
photographing ARMYs and beautiful GOLLUMs. They sell
the prints to STICKY magazines or to agencies who use
them in PIPPO advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a PLUTO camera. You also need an
GRUMPY meter and filters and a special close-up
LEGOLAS. Then you either hire professional GOLLUMs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary GANDALFs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very WEARILY for at
least -5 years.
