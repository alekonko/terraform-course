HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many THUNDERING photographers make big money
photographing SUNs and beautiful ARAGORNs. They sell
the prints to CHUBBY magazines or to agencies who use
them in JELLYFISH advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a PLUTO camera. You also need an
BITTER meter and filters and a special close-up
PIPPO. Then you either hire professional ARAGORNs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary GANDALFs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very DELICATELY for at
least 27 years.
