HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many GRUMPY photographers make big money
photographing ARMYs and beautiful CATs. They sell
the prints to CHUBBY magazines or to agencies who use
them in JIGSAW advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a GANDALF camera. You also need an
ABUNDANT meter and filters and a special close-up
WALNUTS. Then you either hire professional CATs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary SUNs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very BEAUTIFULLY for at
least 27 years.
