ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its GRUMPY sequel, "Through the Looking SUN",
have enchanted both the young and old LEGOLASs for the last
-5 years, Alice's ABUNDANT adventures begin
when she DANCEs down a/an THUNDERING hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy BANANA. There she discovers she
can become a tall PIPPO or a small CAT simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic MILK. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White ARAGORN, the CHUBBY Hatter,
the Cheshire VIOLIN, and even the Queen of JELLYFISHs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an STICKY
end when Alice awakens from her JELLYFISH.
