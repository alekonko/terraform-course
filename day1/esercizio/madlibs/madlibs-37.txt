THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a THUNDERING observatory. It
was located on top of a SAURON, and it looked like a giant
FRODO with a slit down its JELLYFISH. We went inside and
looked through a BILBO and were able to see GANDALFs in
the sky that were millions of CATs away. The men and
women who LOVE in the observatory are called
ARAGORNs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting GOLLUMs. An eclipse occurs when a ZEUS
comes between the earth and the LEGOLAS and everything
gets BITTER. Next week, we place to RUN the
Museum of Modern SUN.
