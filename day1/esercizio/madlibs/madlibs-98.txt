HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many BITTER photographers make big money
photographing BANANAs and beautiful ARAGORNs. They sell
the prints to GRUMPY magazines or to agencies who use
them in GOLLUM advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a JELLYFISH camera. You also need an
THUNDERING meter and filters and a special close-up
ZEUS. Then you either hire professional ARAGORNs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary FRODOs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very WEARILY for at
least 73 years.
