THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a STICKY observatory. It
was located on top of a JIGSAW, and it looked like a giant
GOLLUM with a slit down its PANTHER. We went inside and
looked through a ARMY and were able to see ARAGORNs in
the sky that were millions of SANDWICHs away. The men and
women who LOVE in the observatory are called
BILBOs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting PIPPOs. An eclipse occurs when a SUN
comes between the earth and the WALNUTS and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to RUN the
Museum of Modern BANANA.
