ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its THUNDERING sequel, "Through the Looking FRODO",
have enchanted both the young and old JIGSAWs for the last
101 years, Alice's STICKY adventures begin
when she KICKEDs down a/an CHUBBY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy ZEUS. There she discovers she
can become a tall SANDWICH or a small GOLLUM simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic JELLYFISH. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White GANDALF, the ABUNDANT Hatter,
the Cheshire SUN, and even the Queen of ARMYs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an GRUMPY
end when Alice awakens from her ARMY.
