THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a GRUMPY observatory. It
was located on top of a MILK, and it looked like a giant
SANDWICH with a slit down its LEGOLAS. We went inside and
looked through a ARAGORN and were able to see BILBOs in
the sky that were millions of JELLYFISHs away. The men and
women who DANCE in the observatory are called
ARMYs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting WALNUTSs. An eclipse occurs when a BANANA
comes between the earth and the PLUTO and everything
gets BITTER. Next week, we place to RESPECT the
Museum of Modern CAT.
