ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its STICKY sequel, "Through the Looking GANDALF",
have enchanted both the young and old ARAGORNs for the last
42 years, Alice's ABUNDANT adventures begin
when she KICKEDs down a/an THUNDERING hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy PLUTO. There she discovers she
can become a tall MILK or a small VIOLIN simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic LEGOLAS. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice BAKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White PANTHER, the CHUBBY Hatter,
the Cheshire CAT, and even the Queen of BANANAs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an GRUMPY
end when Alice awakens from her BANANA.
