THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a GRUMPY observatory. It
was located on top of a MILK, and it looked like a giant
ZEUS with a slit down its GOLLUM. We went inside and
looked through a ARAGORN and were able to see PANTHERs in
the sky that were millions of CATs away. The men and
women who RESPECT in the observatory are called
VIOLINs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting WALNUTSs. An eclipse occurs when a SANDWICH
comes between the earth and the ARMY and everything
gets BITTER. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern BILBO.
