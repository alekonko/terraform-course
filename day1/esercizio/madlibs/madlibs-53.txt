HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many THUNDERING photographers make big money
photographing SUNs and beautiful MILKs. They sell
the prints to STICKY magazines or to agencies who use
them in GOLLUM advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a CAT camera. You also need an
BITTER meter and filters and a special close-up
JELLYFISH. Then you either hire professional MILKs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary PANTHERs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very TRUTHFULLY for at
least 42 years.
