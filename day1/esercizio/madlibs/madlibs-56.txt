HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many THUNDERING photographers make big money
photographing SUNs and beautiful CATs. They sell
the prints to BITTER magazines or to agencies who use
them in BANANA advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a SAURON camera. You also need an
STICKY meter and filters and a special close-up
FRODO. Then you either hire professional CATs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary GOLLUMs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very QUICKLY for at
least 27 years.
