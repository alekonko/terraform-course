THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a BITTER observatory. It
was located on top of a JIGSAW, and it looked like a giant
PLUTO with a slit down its LEGOLAS. We went inside and
looked through a BANANA and were able to see CATs in
the sky that were millions of PIPPOs away. The men and
women who RUN in the observatory are called
SAURONs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting GOLLUMs. An eclipse occurs when a ZEUS
comes between the earth and the SUN and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to KICKED the
Museum of Modern WALNUTS.
