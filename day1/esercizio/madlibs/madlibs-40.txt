THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a GRUMPY observatory. It
was located on top of a ARWEN, and it looked like a giant
GOLLUM with a slit down its CAT. We went inside and
looked through a PLUTO and were able to see SUNs in
the sky that were millions of BILBOs away. The men and
women who LOVE in the observatory are called
JELLYFISHs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting MILKs. An eclipse occurs when a PIPPO
comes between the earth and the ZEUS and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to RUN the
Museum of Modern ARAGORN.
