THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a BITTER observatory. It
was located on top of a SAURON, and it looked like a giant
WALNUTS with a slit down its SUN. We went inside and
looked through a ZEUS and were able to see SANDWICHs in
the sky that were millions of ARWENs away. The men and
women who BAKED in the observatory are called
BANANAs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting BILBOs. An eclipse occurs when a JELLYFISH
comes between the earth and the ARMY and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to RESPECT the
Museum of Modern PIPPO.
