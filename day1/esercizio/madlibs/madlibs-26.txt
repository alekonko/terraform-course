HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many BITTER photographers make big money
photographing VIOLINs and beautiful JELLYFISHs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in LEGOLAS advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a GOLLUM camera. You also need an
CHUBBY meter and filters and a special close-up
PIPPO. Then you either hire professional JELLYFISHs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary SAURONs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very BEAUTIFULLY for at
least -5 years.
