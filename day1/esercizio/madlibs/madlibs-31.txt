THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a GRUMPY observatory. It
was located on top of a SAURON, and it looked like a giant
MILK with a slit down its GOLLUM. We went inside and
looked through a CAT and were able to see GANDALFs in
the sky that were millions of JELLYFISHs away. The men and
women who BAKED in the observatory are called
VIOLINs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting PIPPOs. An eclipse occurs when a FRODO
comes between the earth and the SUN and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to DANCE the
Museum of Modern SANDWICH.
