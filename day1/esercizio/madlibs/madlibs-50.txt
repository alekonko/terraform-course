HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many ABUNDANT photographers make big money
photographing LEGOLASs and beautiful BANANAs. They sell
the prints to BITTER magazines or to agencies who use
them in FRODO advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a ARAGORN camera. You also need an
CHUBBY meter and filters and a special close-up
BILBO. Then you either hire professional BANANAs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary VIOLINs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very WEARILY for at
least 0 years.
