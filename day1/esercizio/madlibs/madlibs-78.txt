ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its CHUBBY sequel, "Through the Looking SUN",
have enchanted both the young and old PANTHERs for the last
42 years, Alice's ABUNDANT adventures begin
when she DANCEs down a/an STICKY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy BANANA. There she discovers she
can become a tall ARMY or a small PLUTO simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic ARWEN. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RUNs such remarkable
characters as the White ZEUS, the BITTER Hatter,
the Cheshire ARAGORN, and even the Queen of MILKs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an THUNDERING
end when Alice awakens from her MILK.
