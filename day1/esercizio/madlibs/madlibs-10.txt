THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a STICKY observatory. It
was located on top of a MILK, and it looked like a giant
FRODO with a slit down its PANTHER. We went inside and
looked through a CAT and were able to see PLUTOs in
the sky that were millions of ARAGORNs away. The men and
women who DANCE in the observatory are called
PIPPOs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting LEGOLASs. An eclipse occurs when a WALNUTS
comes between the earth and the BILBO and everything
gets CHUBBY. Next week, we place to KICKED the
Museum of Modern GOLLUM.
