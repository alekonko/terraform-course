HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many STICKY photographers make big money
photographing ARAGORNs and beautiful VIOLINs. They sell
the prints to ABUNDANT magazines or to agencies who use
them in SAURON advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a WALNUTS camera. You also need an
GRUMPY meter and filters and a special close-up
ARMY. Then you either hire professional VIOLINs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary PIPPOs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very QUICKLY for at
least 0 years.
