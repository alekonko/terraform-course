THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a THUNDERING observatory. It
was located on top of a GANDALF, and it looked like a giant
MILK with a slit down its FRODO. We went inside and
looked through a SANDWICH and were able to see BANANAs in
the sky that were millions of VIOLINs away. The men and
women who LOVE in the observatory are called
JIGSAWs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting ARAGORNs. An eclipse occurs when a LEGOLAS
comes between the earth and the ZEUS and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern ARMY.
