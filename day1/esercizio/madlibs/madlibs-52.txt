THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a ABUNDANT observatory. It
was located on top of a SUN, and it looked like a giant
GANDALF with a slit down its VIOLIN. We went inside and
looked through a ARWEN and were able to see WALNUTSs in
the sky that were millions of CATs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
SANDWICHs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting ARMYs. An eclipse occurs when a BANANA
comes between the earth and the ARAGORN and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to DANCE the
Museum of Modern FRODO.
