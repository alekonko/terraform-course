ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its GRUMPY sequel, "Through the Looking BILBO",
have enchanted both the young and old ZEUSs for the last
27 years, Alice's STICKY adventures begin
when she KICKEDs down a/an BITTER hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy PANTHER. There she discovers she
can become a tall LEGOLAS or a small PLUTO simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic MILK. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White GOLLUM, the ABUNDANT Hatter,
the Cheshire ARAGORN, and even the Queen of SUNs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an CHUBBY
end when Alice awakens from her SUN.
