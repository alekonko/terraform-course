THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a BITTER observatory. It
was located on top of a GOLLUM, and it looked like a giant
JELLYFISH with a slit down its JIGSAW. We went inside and
looked through a SANDWICH and were able to see BANANAs in
the sky that were millions of WALNUTSs away. The men and
women who BAKED in the observatory are called
PIPPOs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting VIOLINs. An eclipse occurs when a CAT
comes between the earth and the ARWEN and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to RESPECT the
Museum of Modern PLUTO.
