HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many BITTER photographers make big money
photographing ARWENs and beautiful JIGSAWs. They sell
the prints to GRUMPY magazines or to agencies who use
them in FRODO advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a ARMY camera. You also need an
CHUBBY meter and filters and a special close-up
ARAGORN. Then you either hire professional JIGSAWs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary BILBOs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very WEARILY for at
least 42 years.
