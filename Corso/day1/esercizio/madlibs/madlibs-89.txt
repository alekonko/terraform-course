HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many STICKY photographers make big money
photographing GANDALFs and beautiful MILKs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in ZEUS advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a WALNUTS camera. You also need an
ABUNDANT meter and filters and a special close-up
BANANA. Then you either hire professional MILKs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary SAURONs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very DELICATELY for at
least 0 years.
