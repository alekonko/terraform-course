ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its THUNDERING sequel, "Through the Looking MILK",
have enchanted both the young and old JELLYFISHs for the last
73 years, Alice's STICKY adventures begin
when she KICKEDs down a/an ABUNDANT hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy SANDWICH. There she discovers she
can become a tall VIOLIN or a small BILBO simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic GANDALF. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RESPECTs such remarkable
characters as the White WALNUTS, the BITTER Hatter,
the Cheshire JIGSAW, and even the Queen of ARAGORNs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an CHUBBY
end when Alice awakens from her ARAGORN.
