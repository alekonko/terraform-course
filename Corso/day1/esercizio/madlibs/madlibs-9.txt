ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its ABUNDANT sequel, "Through the Looking GOLLUM",
have enchanted both the young and old FRODOs for the last
0 years, Alice's CHUBBY adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an STICKY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy JELLYFISH. There she discovers she
can become a tall WALNUTS or a small PANTHER simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic JIGSAW. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White CAT, the GRUMPY Hatter,
the Cheshire ZEUS, and even the Queen of LEGOLASs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an BITTER
end when Alice awakens from her LEGOLAS.
