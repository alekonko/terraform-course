ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its CHUBBY sequel, "Through the Looking LEGOLAS",
have enchanted both the young and old ARMYs for the last
42 years, Alice's BITTER adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an STICKY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy VIOLIN. There she discovers she
can become a tall JIGSAW or a small PIPPO simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic ARWEN. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RUNs such remarkable
characters as the White WALNUTS, the ABUNDANT Hatter,
the Cheshire SUN, and even the Queen of MILKs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an THUNDERING
end when Alice awakens from her MILK.
