THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a STICKY observatory. It
was located on top of a ARMY, and it looked like a giant
SAURON with a slit down its WALNUTS. We went inside and
looked through a ARWEN and were able to see SANDWICHs in
the sky that were millions of BANANAs away. The men and
women who BAKED in the observatory are called
PIPPOs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting SUNs. An eclipse occurs when a GANDALF
comes between the earth and the FRODO and everything
gets ABUNDANT. Next week, we place to DANCE the
Museum of Modern JIGSAW.
