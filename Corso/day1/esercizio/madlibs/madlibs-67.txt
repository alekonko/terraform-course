THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a THUNDERING observatory. It
was located on top of a LEGOLAS, and it looked like a giant
ARMY with a slit down its PIPPO. We went inside and
looked through a SANDWICH and were able to see GOLLUMs in
the sky that were millions of JIGSAWs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
WALNUTSs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting PANTHERs. An eclipse occurs when a BILBO
comes between the earth and the JELLYFISH and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to RESPECT the
Museum of Modern MILK.
