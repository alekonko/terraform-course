HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many BITTER photographers make big money
photographing ARMYs and beautiful LEGOLASs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in SANDWICH advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a MILK camera. You also need an
CHUBBY meter and filters and a special close-up
CAT. Then you either hire professional LEGOLASs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary GOLLUMs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very TRUTHFULLY for at
least 42 years.
