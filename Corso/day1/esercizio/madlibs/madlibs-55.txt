THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a BITTER observatory. It
was located on top of a BILBO, and it looked like a giant
SUN with a slit down its VIOLIN. We went inside and
looked through a WALNUTS and were able to see JELLYFISHs in
the sky that were millions of PIPPOs away. The men and
women who RUN in the observatory are called
CATs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting SANDWICHs. An eclipse occurs when a ARMY
comes between the earth and the BANANA and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to DANCE the
Museum of Modern ZEUS.
