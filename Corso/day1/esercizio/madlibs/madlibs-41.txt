HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many ABUNDANT photographers make big money
photographing JELLYFISHs and beautiful ARAGORNs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in PIPPO advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a GOLLUM camera. You also need an
STICKY meter and filters and a special close-up
ARMY. Then you either hire professional ARAGORNs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary FRODOs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very WEARILY for at
least 101 years.
