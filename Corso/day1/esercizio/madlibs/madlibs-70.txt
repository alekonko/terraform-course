THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a BITTER observatory. It
was located on top of a FRODO, and it looked like a giant
JIGSAW with a slit down its LEGOLAS. We went inside and
looked through a VIOLIN and were able to see PIPPOs in
the sky that were millions of WALNUTSs away. The men and
women who BAKED in the observatory are called
BANANAs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting BILBOs. An eclipse occurs when a GANDALF
comes between the earth and the PLUTO and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to LOVE the
Museum of Modern MILK.
