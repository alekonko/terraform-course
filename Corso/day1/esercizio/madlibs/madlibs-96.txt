ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its THUNDERING sequel, "Through the Looking BANANA",
have enchanted both the young and old PIPPOs for the last
-5 years, Alice's CHUBBY adventures begin
when she KICKEDs down a/an GRUMPY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy CAT. There she discovers she
can become a tall JELLYFISH or a small SANDWICH simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic FRODO. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice DANCEs such remarkable
characters as the White ARMY, the ABUNDANT Hatter,
the Cheshire WALNUTS, and even the Queen of ARAGORNs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an STICKY
end when Alice awakens from her ARAGORN.
