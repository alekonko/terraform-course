THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a GRUMPY observatory. It
was located on top of a PANTHER, and it looked like a giant
FRODO with a slit down its VIOLIN. We went inside and
looked through a ZEUS and were able to see SUNs in
the sky that were millions of SANDWICHs away. The men and
women who DANCE in the observatory are called
LEGOLASs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting ARMYs. An eclipse occurs when a ARWEN
comes between the earth and the GOLLUM and everything
gets BITTER. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern WALNUTS.
