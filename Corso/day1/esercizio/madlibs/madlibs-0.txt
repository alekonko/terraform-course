ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its BITTER sequel, "Through the Looking LEGOLAS",
have enchanted both the young and old SUNs for the last
-5 years, Alice's ABUNDANT adventures begin
when she DANCEs down a/an CHUBBY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy JELLYFISH. There she discovers she
can become a tall CAT or a small PIPPO simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic GOLLUM. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice KICKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White PLUTO, the THUNDERING Hatter,
the Cheshire BANANA, and even the Queen of SAURONs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an STICKY
end when Alice awakens from her SAURON.
