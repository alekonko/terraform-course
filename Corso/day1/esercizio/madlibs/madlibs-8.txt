HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many BITTER photographers make big money
photographing LEGOLASs and beautiful WALNUTSs. They sell
the prints to CHUBBY magazines or to agencies who use
them in BILBO advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a GOLLUM camera. You also need an
GRUMPY meter and filters and a special close-up
CAT. Then you either hire professional WALNUTSs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary JELLYFISHs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very QUICKLY for at
least 27 years.
