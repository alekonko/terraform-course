THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a GRUMPY observatory. It
was located on top of a MILK, and it looked like a giant
ZEUS with a slit down its LEGOLAS. We went inside and
looked through a SUN and were able to see CATs in
the sky that were millions of SANDWICHs away. The men and
women who LOVE in the observatory are called
FRODOs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting GANDALFs. An eclipse occurs when a ARMY
comes between the earth and the WALNUTS and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to DANCE the
Museum of Modern JIGSAW.
