HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many ABUNDANT photographers make big money
photographing PIPPOs and beautiful BILBOs. They sell
the prints to BITTER magazines or to agencies who use
them in WALNUTS advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a SAURON camera. You also need an
CHUBBY meter and filters and a special close-up
ARWEN. Then you either hire professional BILBOs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary PANTHERs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very WEARILY for at
least 27 years.
