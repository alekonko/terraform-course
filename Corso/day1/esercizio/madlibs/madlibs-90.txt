ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its BITTER sequel, "Through the Looking PIPPO",
have enchanted both the young and old PANTHERs for the last
73 years, Alice's THUNDERING adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an ABUNDANT hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy MILK. There she discovers she
can become a tall VIOLIN or a small SANDWICH simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic GANDALF. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White CAT, the STICKY Hatter,
the Cheshire JIGSAW, and even the Queen of BANANAs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an GRUMPY
end when Alice awakens from her BANANA.
