HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many CHUBBY photographers make big money
photographing SUNs and beautiful ARWENs. They sell
the prints to STICKY magazines or to agencies who use
them in VIOLIN advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a BANANA camera. You also need an
GRUMPY meter and filters and a special close-up
SANDWICH. Then you either hire professional ARWENs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary PLUTOs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very BEAUTIFULLY for at
least 73 years.
