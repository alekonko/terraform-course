HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many STICKY photographers make big money
photographing PANTHERs and beautiful BILBOs. They sell
the prints to ABUNDANT magazines or to agencies who use
them in JELLYFISH advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a PIPPO camera. You also need an
CHUBBY meter and filters and a special close-up
BANANA. Then you either hire professional BILBOs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary WALNUTSs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very QUICKLY for at
least 42 years.
