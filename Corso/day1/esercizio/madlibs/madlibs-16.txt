THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a BITTER observatory. It
was located on top of a JELLYFISH, and it looked like a giant
PIPPO with a slit down its WALNUTS. We went inside and
looked through a CAT and were able to see FRODOs in
the sky that were millions of PANTHERs away. The men and
women who RESPECT in the observatory are called
SANDWICHs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting PLUTOs. An eclipse occurs when a MILK
comes between the earth and the ARWEN and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to DANCE the
Museum of Modern ZEUS.
