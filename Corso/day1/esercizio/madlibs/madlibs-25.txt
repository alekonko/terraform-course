THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a STICKY observatory. It
was located on top of a BANANA, and it looked like a giant
CAT with a slit down its MILK. We went inside and
looked through a ARMY and were able to see JELLYFISHs in
the sky that were millions of SUNs away. The men and
women who RUN in the observatory are called
SANDWICHs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting FRODOs. An eclipse occurs when a PIPPO
comes between the earth and the ARWEN and everything
gets ABUNDANT. Next week, we place to LOVE the
Museum of Modern ARAGORN.
