ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its THUNDERING sequel, "Through the Looking SUN",
have enchanted both the young and old GOLLUMs for the last
101 years, Alice's GRUMPY adventures begin
when she KICKEDs down a/an ABUNDANT hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy BILBO. There she discovers she
can become a tall PIPPO or a small CAT simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic PANTHER. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White JIGSAW, the CHUBBY Hatter,
the Cheshire VIOLIN, and even the Queen of SAURONs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an STICKY
end when Alice awakens from her SAURON.
