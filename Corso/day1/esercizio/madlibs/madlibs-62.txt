HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many BITTER photographers make big money
photographing ARWENs and beautiful SUNs. They sell
the prints to GRUMPY magazines or to agencies who use
them in PLUTO advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a ZEUS camera. You also need an
STICKY meter and filters and a special close-up
SANDWICH. Then you either hire professional SUNs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary LEGOLASs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very BEAUTIFULLY for at
least 101 years.
