THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a BITTER observatory. It
was located on top of a GOLLUM, and it looked like a giant
CAT with a slit down its ZEUS. We went inside and
looked through a FRODO and were able to see SAURONs in
the sky that were millions of PLUTOs away. The men and
women who LOVE in the observatory are called
BANANAs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting GANDALFs. An eclipse occurs when a PIPPO
comes between the earth and the SANDWICH and everything
gets ABUNDANT. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern SUN.
