HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many STICKY photographers make big money
photographing JELLYFISHs and beautiful SANDWICHs. They sell
the prints to GRUMPY magazines or to agencies who use
them in GANDALF advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a PLUTO camera. You also need an
THUNDERING meter and filters and a special close-up
GOLLUM. Then you either hire professional SANDWICHs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary ARWENs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very QUICKLY for at
least 0 years.
