ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its STICKY sequel, "Through the Looking PLUTO",
have enchanted both the young and old JIGSAWs for the last
73 years, Alice's CHUBBY adventures begin
when she DANCEs down a/an BITTER hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy BILBO. There she discovers she
can become a tall JELLYFISH or a small MILK simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic ARMY. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White ARAGORN, the THUNDERING Hatter,
the Cheshire GANDALF, and even the Queen of ARWENs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an ABUNDANT
end when Alice awakens from her ARWEN.
