THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a ABUNDANT observatory. It
was located on top of a BILBO, and it looked like a giant
VIOLIN with a slit down its ARAGORN. We went inside and
looked through a PLUTO and were able to see GANDALFs in
the sky that were millions of ARWENs away. The men and
women who DANCE in the observatory are called
CATs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting WALNUTSs. An eclipse occurs when a PIPPO
comes between the earth and the BANANA and everything
gets CHUBBY. Next week, we place to LOVE the
Museum of Modern JELLYFISH.
