ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its GRUMPY sequel, "Through the Looking LEGOLAS",
have enchanted both the young and old PIPPOs for the last
101 years, Alice's ABUNDANT adventures begin
when she DANCEs down a/an BITTER hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy BILBO. There she discovers she
can become a tall PANTHER or a small MILK simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic ARWEN. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RUNs such remarkable
characters as the White ZEUS, the THUNDERING Hatter,
the Cheshire JELLYFISH, and even the Queen of FRODOs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an STICKY
end when Alice awakens from her FRODO.
