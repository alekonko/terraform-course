HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many THUNDERING photographers make big money
photographing PIPPOs and beautiful BILBOs. They sell
the prints to GRUMPY magazines or to agencies who use
them in PANTHER advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a WALNUTS camera. You also need an
ABUNDANT meter and filters and a special close-up
SAURON. Then you either hire professional BILBOs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary BANANAs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very QUICKLY for at
least -5 years.
