THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a ABUNDANT observatory. It
was located on top of a GANDALF, and it looked like a giant
MILK with a slit down its ARMY. We went inside and
looked through a JIGSAW and were able to see ZEUSs in
the sky that were millions of LEGOLASs away. The men and
women who RESPECT in the observatory are called
ARWENs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting SUNs. An eclipse occurs when a VIOLIN
comes between the earth and the SANDWICH and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to KICKED the
Museum of Modern FRODO.
