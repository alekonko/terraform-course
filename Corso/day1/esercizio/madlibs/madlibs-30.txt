ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its BITTER sequel, "Through the Looking SUN",
have enchanted both the young and old ARWENs for the last
101 years, Alice's THUNDERING adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an STICKY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy ARAGORN. There she discovers she
can become a tall PANTHER or a small BANANA simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic LEGOLAS. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice KICKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White SAURON, the GRUMPY Hatter,
the Cheshire CAT, and even the Queen of BILBOs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an CHUBBY
end when Alice awakens from her BILBO.
