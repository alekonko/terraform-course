HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many GRUMPY photographers make big money
photographing BILBOs and beautiful MILKs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in CAT advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a LEGOLAS camera. You also need an
STICKY meter and filters and a special close-up
FRODO. Then you either hire professional MILKs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary JIGSAWs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very WEARILY for at
least 101 years.
