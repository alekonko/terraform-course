THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a ABUNDANT observatory. It
was located on top of a LEGOLAS, and it looked like a giant
PIPPO with a slit down its JIGSAW. We went inside and
looked through a PLUTO and were able to see CATs in
the sky that were millions of MILKs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
ARWENs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting ZEUSs. An eclipse occurs when a WALNUTS
comes between the earth and the SANDWICH and everything
gets CHUBBY. Next week, we place to DANCE the
Museum of Modern PANTHER.
