HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many BITTER photographers make big money
photographing CATs and beautiful WALNUTSs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in SANDWICH advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a BILBO camera. You also need an
CHUBBY meter and filters and a special close-up
GOLLUM. Then you either hire professional WALNUTSs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary PIPPOs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very WEARILY for at
least 101 years.
