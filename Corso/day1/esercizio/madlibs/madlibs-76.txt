THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a GRUMPY observatory. It
was located on top of a BILBO, and it looked like a giant
LEGOLAS with a slit down its FRODO. We went inside and
looked through a JIGSAW and were able to see GOLLUMs in
the sky that were millions of ZEUSs away. The men and
women who DANCE in the observatory are called
BANANAs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting SUNs. An eclipse occurs when a PIPPO
comes between the earth and the WALNUTS and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to LOVE the
Museum of Modern GANDALF.
