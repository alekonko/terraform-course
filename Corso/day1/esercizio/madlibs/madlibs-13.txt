THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a THUNDERING observatory. It
was located on top of a BANANA, and it looked like a giant
JIGSAW with a slit down its SANDWICH. We went inside and
looked through a ARWEN and were able to see PLUTOs in
the sky that were millions of ARMYs away. The men and
women who LOVE in the observatory are called
ZEUSs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting MILKs. An eclipse occurs when a ARAGORN
comes between the earth and the CAT and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to KICKED the
Museum of Modern VIOLIN.
