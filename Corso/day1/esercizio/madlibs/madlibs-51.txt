ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its THUNDERING sequel, "Through the Looking ARAGORN",
have enchanted both the young and old PLUTOs for the last
73 years, Alice's BITTER adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an CHUBBY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy ARWEN. There she discovers she
can become a tall WALNUTS or a small ARMY simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic PIPPO. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RUNs such remarkable
characters as the White MILK, the STICKY Hatter,
the Cheshire SAURON, and even the Queen of SUNs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an ABUNDANT
end when Alice awakens from her SUN.
