ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its ABUNDANT sequel, "Through the Looking GOLLUM",
have enchanted both the young and old ZEUSs for the last
101 years, Alice's STICKY adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an BITTER hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy MILK. There she discovers she
can become a tall BILBO or a small PLUTO simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic ARAGORN. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White ARMY, the CHUBBY Hatter,
the Cheshire PIPPO, and even the Queen of ARWENs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an THUNDERING
end when Alice awakens from her ARWEN.
